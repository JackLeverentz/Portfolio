            <p class="story" id="intro">Ever since I was a little kid, I've always been fascinated with technology and computers. 
                I was handed down my parents old IBM computer that ran Windows 97 when I was 5 years old. 
                I started out by playing computer games and messing around with native windows programs on 
                it (word, powerpoint, etc)... In high school, I took courses on video editing and simple 
                graphic design. This really pushed my passion for computers to a new level, and I didn’t 
                want to stop there.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I came to the University of North Dakota in 2015 I didn’t see myself learning anything 
                else but marketing/general business. In my sophomore year, one of my Fraternity Brother’s 
                and I came up with an idea for a mobile app that universities could use to further their 
                communication. After going through the process and watching our developer build the 
                product, I really had a hunger to dive into the world of development and start coding 
                myself.

                A year later in the Spring Semester of my Junior year, I enrolled in Computer science 
                160, Introduction to Computer Science. In this class, we learned the basics of 
                programming, data structures, and the ins and outs of Java. This class was by 
                far the most difficult introduction level class I had ever taken, but it was a 
                great base for learning different languages, libraries, and tools that helped
                me down the road in my learning. 
            </p>
            <p id="later"> 
                Following that over the next 8 months I took an online web developer bootcamp on 
                Udemy.com <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Click here to check it out</a>, 
                I would highly this for anyone who wants to get into web development, great course and great 
                instructor. This course starts you off at the beginning and the basics and takes 
                you all the way into deployment. You learn many different languages, libraries, frameworks, tools,
                and best practices and techniques. Through many projects, exercises, and lectures, this taught me 
                everything that I needed to know to start in full-stack web development and I plan on taking the advanced course in the future. 
                After the course, I built a project to test out my knowledge in the course and apply 
                everything without the help of the instructor. 
            </p>
            <p id="later">
                Going forward I look forward to continue to work with and learn from creative, highly talented 
                individuals and stay in front of the curve in today’s cutting-edge technology.
